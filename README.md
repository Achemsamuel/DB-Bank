# DB-Bank
DB Bank is a mobile bank application for making quick and easy transactions with your ATM card. 

The Google Services Plist file for the app has been intentionally excluded. It can however be made avaiabe on request.
After the plist file has been gotten, copy it into the main project directory and build project.

For the first time you will need to push an amount to the database to set the intial balance on the account tagged by an email and a user id generated by Firebase.
You can push the balance to the DB from the SuperViewController's ViewDidLoad, however, do this only once to avoid malfunctions with retrieving the right balance after a transaction.

The balance as well as the trasactions are sent tand stored in the Database. When the app is run, it loops through the json data for the current logged in user and picks their data (account information, history and userID), then after verification it populates the view with the logged in user's correct data.
